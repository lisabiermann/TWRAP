# TWrap
TWrap is a C++ wrapper class around the [Eigen3-unsupported Tensor Module](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/unsupported/group__CXX11__Tensor__Module.html).

It is built via
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

A template executable - illustrating some core functionality - is provided and can be executed as
```
cd build
./bin/template
```

Unit tests can be run after compiling using `ctest`.
